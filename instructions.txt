Hello

To run my version of Marvel Superheroes Wars, you just have to open "index.html" with the browser of your choice and the game should open right up.

To change the characters / planets, it's a bit tricky but not that hard. In the folder "/configuration" you open up characters.js / planets.js and change the content of the "var characters" / "var planets" to the content of a json containing the characters / planets of your choice.
I did this because this whole game is run locally and on some browsers I encountered a xmlhttprequest error when importing json's in my project and I wanted to make it work on at least every browser I currently have installed (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

Thanks for reading this, have fun!
